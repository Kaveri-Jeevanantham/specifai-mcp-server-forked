As a member collaborating on a topic, I want to upload files into the chat seamlessly and share them with others. Acceptance Criteria: The chat composer must display a file upload button. Users must be able to select files of various types (e.g., images, PDFs, etc.). The system should enforce a file size limit and display a validation message if exceeded. Users must be able to drag and drop files into the chat composer with a visual indication (e.g., highlighted drop zone) to initiate uploads. Uploaded files must appear in the chat as downloadable links. A notification must be displayed upon a successful upload. If a file exceeds the size limit or is an unsupported format, the system must notify the user with error feedback and suggested corrective actions (e.g., resizing or format change).",
