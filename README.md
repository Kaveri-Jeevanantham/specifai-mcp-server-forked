# Specifai MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for [Specif-ai](https://github.com/presidio-oss/specif-ai) project integration and automation with any MCP-compatible AI tool. This server is designed to work with tool agnostic, meaning it can be used with any tool that supports the MCP protocol. This server currently expose tools to read all documents generated by Specifai project.

> [!WARNING]
> This server is currently in experimental. The functionality and available tools are subject to change and expansion as we continue to develop and improve the server.

Get started quickly, see [Configuration](#configuration) for more details:

## Installation

```bash
# Latest version
npx --yes @presidio-dev/specifai-mcp-server@latest

# Specific version
npx --yes @presidio-dev/specifai-mcp-server@1.2.3
```

we used `npx` to install the server, but you can use any node package manager of your preference such as `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`, etc.

## Configuration

with [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) with latest version:

```json
{
  "specif-ai": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["--yes", "@presidio-dev/specifai-mcp-server@latest"],
    "disabled": false,
    "autoApprove": []
  }
}
```

with [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) with specific version:

```json
{
  "specif-ai": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["--yes", "@presidio-dev/specifai-mcp-server@1.2.3"],
    "disabled": false,
    "autoApprove": []
  }
}
```

### Preparing your project

> This is completely optional, but it's recommended to use it to avoid having to specify the project directory path every time you access the server. For AI IDE / Extension (Hai Build), it's recommended to use a `.specif-ai-path` file to specify the project directory path.

Make sure you project root directory contains a `.specif-ai-path` file. It's how the Speccifai MCP server know where to find the specification documents generated by Specifai.

The file is a plain text file containing the absolute path to the project directory where the specification documents for an project are stored.

For example, if your project directory is located at `/path/to/project`, the `.specif-ai-path` file should contain the following line:

```
/path/to/project
```

### Available Tools

The server provides several tools for interacting with your specification documents:

| Tool Name          | Description                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
